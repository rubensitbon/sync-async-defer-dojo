# sync-async-defer-dojo

## How it works ?

### How sync works ?

Sync is going to stop the HTML parsing to execute the JS

### How async works ?

Async is going to start the download of the script asynchronously and execute it as soon it's loaded

### How defer works ?

Defer is going to start the download of the script asynchronously and execute it as soon the page is loaded

## Result

"A good strategy is to use async when possible, and then defer when async isnâ€™t an option." Digital OCean
